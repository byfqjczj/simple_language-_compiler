This project is a compiler for a simple language called FUN:

(1) writing a simple-minded compiler (fun => aarch64 assembly)

    - written in C/C++
    - compiled on x86-64
    - runs on x86-64

(2) assembling the generated code using the aarch64 cross tools

    - runs on x86-64
    - accepts AArch64 assembly
    - produces AArch64 executable

(3) running the generated executable using qemu-aarach64

    - runs on x86-64
    - emulates aarch64

The Makefile automates all that.
FUN language specs:
The language has no formal definition. It is defined by the given interpreter
 - all values are encoded as 64 bit unsigned binary numbers
 - print <expression>      // prints the value of the expression
                               // as a 64 bit unsigned quantity

-  <identifier> = <expression> // assign the value of the expression
                                   // to the identifier
- operators are +, -, *, /, %. Same precedence, associativity, and
      semantics as C

- '(' and ')' are used to change precedence

- identifiers must start with an alphabetic character and contain
      alphanumeric characters

- operators (<=, <, >=, ">", "==", "!=", "&&", "||", ",", "&") with the
  same semantics, precedence, and associativity) as their C counterparts

- "if" statement (with optional "else"):

    if <expression> <statement> [else <statement>]

- "while" statement:

    while <expression> statement

- "func" expression:

    func <statement>

    Defines a function that runs the given statement when called.
    All functions take exactly one uint64_t argument and return
    one uint64_t value.

    The <statement> can access the passed argument as the local
    variable named "it"

    "func" doesn't run the statement; it returns an opaque uint64_t
    that identifies the function.

- function call expression:

    <identifier>(<expression>)

    Calls the given function, passing it the result of evaluating
    <expression>. The value of the whole expression is the value
    returned by the function; 0 if there is no return

- "return" statement:

    return <expression>

    Can only be used inside a function. Returns from the function with
    the value of the given expression


To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s test

To run one test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test

To run by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make
    ./build/funcc t0.fun
    qemu-aarch64 ./t0.arm x y z
